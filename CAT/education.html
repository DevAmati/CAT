    <h1>Education Journey</h1>

    <p>After completing my class 8 in 2016, I embarked on a new chapter at St. Paul's Highschool. It was here that I not only gained an education but also made lifelong friends who added color to my academic journey.</p>

    <p>At St. Paul's, I discovered my love for basketball and decided to switch from soccer. The thrill of the game and the camaraderie with my teammates made it an easy choice. It wasn't just a sport; it became a passion.</p>

    <p>Despite being an average student, I embraced the challenges of academia. The lessons learned in and out of the classroom were invaluable. These experiences shaped me, teaching me more than just what textbooks could offer.</p>

    <p>Fast forward to today, and I find myself at Zetech University, currently in the 2.2 stage. It's incredible how each step of my education journey has led me to this moment, typing out my story in code.</p>

    <p>Join me as I reflect on the lessons learned, friendships made, and the growth that came with each educational milestone. The journey continues, and I'm excited for what lies ahead!</p>
