    <h1>Childhood Memories</h1>

    <p>Hi there! I'm Morgan, and this is a glimpse into my wonderful childhood.</p>

    <p>I spent my early years living with my grandma, who filled my days with love and warmth. It was a time of joy and innocence, surrounded by the care of a wise and loving grandmother.</p>

    <p>After school, I had three amazing friends who made every afternoon an adventure. We played together, laughed together, and created memories that I'll cherish forever.</p>

    <p>My educational journey began at Masaba Primary School, where I took my first steps into the world of learning. The school became a place of discovery, friendship, and growth.</p>

    <p>Come join me on this nostalgic journey as I recount the tales of a time when life was simple, and every moment was filled with wonder!</p>
