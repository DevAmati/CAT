    <h1>My Skills</h1>

    <p>Cooking is not just a task for me; it's an art form. I have a knack for creating delicious dishes, and one of my specialties is a mouth-watering egg curry. Check it out below:</p>

    <p>Whenever guests arrive, I'm always up to the task of preparing a delightful meal for them. There's something magical about bringing people together through the joy of good food.</p>

    <p>On the tech side, I'm not just a culinary maestro; I'm also expanding my skills in the digital realm. I'm currently learning JavaScript to add to my ever-growing duffel bag of programming languages. I'm already well-versed in React, C, C++, HTML, and Java.</p>

    <p>Whether it's crafting a perfect dish or coding up a storm, I believe in giving my best in everything I do. Life is a blend of flavors and code, and I'm savoring every moment!</p>
